# Sexydown
**Sexydown** is a useful, completely public domain, free website that prints code on paper. It can compile Markdown and Textile markup to HTML and print it with a variety of options, and it can print 118 languages in beautifully syntax-highlighted glory on paper. Better yet, you can create a custom URL using the [URL generator](http://ethanarterberry.com/Sexydown/url.html) that will check the options for you. Sexydown 3 has many new features that make it a fully-featured printing utility belt that you'll keep in your bookmarks for all eternity. If you're a nerd, you will be pleased to hear that Sexydown 3 is public domain on [GitHub.](https://github.com/sargeant45/Sexydown) It uses [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for Markdown parsing and [textile-js](https://github.com/borgar/textile-js) for Textile parsing. All syntax highlighting is done with [highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org). If you want to look at some example outputs, then go [here](http://ethanarterberry.com/Sexydown/ex/ex.html).
