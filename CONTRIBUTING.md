# Contributing to Sexydown
So, you want to contribute to Sexydown, eh? The first thing you should know is where to commit. Once you fork the repo, there are a few places you can add to.

1. `Your Sexydown Folder/js/coffeescript`
2. `Your Sexydown Folder/css`
3. `Your Sexydown Folder/*any HTML file in here you want to add to*`

Keep in mind that when you add to the CoffeeScript files (`parameter.coffee`, `printer.coffee`, and `window.coffee`) you should compile them to their respective spot inside the `compiled` folder. **EDIT:** Also, if you're on Windows, you can quickly use the `compile.bat` batchfile I've included in the directory.

When you're done changing the files, commit them to the `gh-pages` branch and submit a pull request to the Sexydown repo on GitHub. If you haven't deleted everything, skullfucked the code, ruined it, etc., I should be fine adding your changes to Sexydown.
